# Bus-timetable-app
Simple application that manages bus stops and bus lines written in C++.

Main reason of creating this application was to learn about 
memory management and how do pointers work. 

How does app work?
In .txt input files(eg. test.txt) are informations about bus lines and bus stops that the bus drives through.
Program just reads the information about lines from files, sorts the data and creates .txt file for every 
bus stop in the input files(eg. Rynek.txt).
